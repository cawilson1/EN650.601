# EN650.601 Assignment 1 

## Overview
There are two hands-on experiments you are going to implement in this assignment. One is about an important web application security policy; while the other is an real-life attack if such policy is not enforced. Both of them are from [SEED Project](http://www.cis.syr.edu/~wedu/seed/index.html). It is strongly recommended that you do the Same Origin Policy Exploration lab first to become familiar with the lab environment and go through some computer network basics. It would be a lot more easier for you to do the Cross-Site Request Forgery Attack lab after you finish this one.

## Environment Setups
Load the [Virtual Machine (VM) image](http://www.cis.syr.edu/~wedu/SEEDUbuntu12.04.zip) to your Virtualbox or VMware, and be sure to read the [User Manual](http://www.cis.syr.edu/~wedu/seed/Documentation/Ubuntu12_04_VM/Ubuntu12_04_VM_Manual.pdf) carefully before you start working on the labs. Specifically, you might want to pay attention to the descriptions of __Firefox extensions__, __Elgg web application__, and __Collabtive web application__ in section 3.2. 


## Web Same-Origin-Policy Exploration Lab
Go through the [lab description](http://www.cis.syr.edu/~wedu/seed/Labs/Web/Web_SOP_Collabtive/) and complete all tasks listed on it. As a preparation to the second lab, you are not asked to provide a very detailed report for this lab. You only need to clearly describe what you have done and what you have observed.

_--15 Points_

## Cross-Site Request Forgery Attack Lab
Completing the first lab, you're prepared for more advanced excercises. For this lab, you are required to follow all the lab instructions listed on the [lab description](http://www.cis.syr.edu/~wedu/seed/Labs/Web/CSRF_Collabtive/). 

_--35 Points_
