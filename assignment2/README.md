# EN650.601 Lab Assignment 2


## Overview
To get you a grasp of how PKI works, this lab simulates the issuance, revocation, and installation process of digital certificates. Specifically, you will do all your experiments in the GENI environment, and go through those processes with the help of OpenSSL, a widely used cryptographic toolkit. The tasks in this assignment are divided into two lab modules. The first modules focuses on certificate issuance and revocation, while the second module focuses on the chain of trust. Since there are quite a few overlaps between these two modules, getting familiar with the first module will dramatically speed up your pace in the second one. As a result, it is recommended that you complete the first module before you move on to the second one.


## Environment Setup
For each lab module, you have to create a seperate slice in GENI, and reserve resources as decribed in lab manuals. After the resources are available, connect to those VMs through ssh and do the correspondent tasks. If you have difficulty setting up the environment, you might want to check out the [beginner's guide]() for GENI.

## Certificate Issuance and Revocation (25 points)
Go through the [lab manual](module1), and complete all tasks listed on it. Since you are required to include screenshots in your report, it is suggested that you capture screenshots periodically.


## Certificate Authority Hierarchy (25 points)
Go through the [lab manual](module2), and complete all tasks listed on it. Since you are required to include screenshots in your report, it is suggested that you capture screenshots periodically.


## Submission Instructions
- This assignment is due on November 12nd (Monday) 11:59 PM. 
- You will work in a group(to be discussed in class) for this assignment.
- Submit your results for both modules at BlackBoard in one PDF file.
- Only one report is needed from a group. 
- Please list group members in your report explicitly. 
- Please type your solutions and include screenshots. In general NO hand-written report is accepted.
